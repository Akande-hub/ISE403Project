Extracting the underlying structure within datasets is a significant challenge in data science, and various techniques are employed to address this issue. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a standard linear high-dimensional reduction technique that has become an active and interesting area of research. Over the last decade, NMF has garnered significant attention due to its ability to automatically extract interpretable information from nonnegative datasets.

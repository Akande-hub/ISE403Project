Extracting the underlying structure within datasets is a significant challenge in data science, and various techniques are employed to address this issue. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a standard linear high-dimensional reduction technique that has become an active and interesting area of research. Over the last decade, NMF has garnered significant attention due to its ability to automatically extract interpretable information from nonnegative datasets.

Let $\R_+$ be a set of nonnegative real numbers and $\Z_+$ be a set of nonnegative integer numbers. Suppose one is given a data matrix $X \in \R^{m \text{x} n}_+ $  with nonnegative entries and $r \in \Z_+$, a factorization rank. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a problem of finding a factorization such that
\begin{align}\label{1}
    X \approx WH
\end{align} where $W \in \R^{m \text{x} r}_+ $ and $H \in \R^{r \text{x} n}_+$. The factorization rank $r$ is usually chosen such that $r << \frac{mn}{m+n}$. It represents the number of components or basis elements to approximate the original nonnegative matrix; we obtain a compressed representation of the original data using a smaller rank.
